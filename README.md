## Game information
The folder game_1st_gen contains all the information about the sellers' games fron the first generation. Likewise, the folder game_2nd_gen contains all the informastion about the children's games from the second generation.
### How Labeling of the game folders work.
The first generation had ten sellers numbered one to ten. The second generation had ten children numbered one through ten. Hence the folder Game_1_of_1_2, in game_1st_gen folder, contains information about the game between Seller 1 and Seller 2. While the folder Game_1_of_1_2, in game_2nd_gen folder, contains information about the game between Child 1 and Child 2. The last two numbers of the folders' names indicate which of the sellers/children were involved in the game.
